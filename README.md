# OOP 1 (Course Practical Works - UFAZ University)

Welcome to the repository for my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 1** course at **UFAZ University**.

## About
This repository contains all the codes, projects, and exercises developed during the OOP 1 course. It showcases various object-oriented programming concepts and practical implementations, including:
- Class and Object Design
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Exception Handling
- Data Structures (e.g., Stacks, Arrays, etc.)
- GUI Development with Java Swing

## Structure
The repository is organized into the following sections:
- **Assignments**: Homework and assignments from the course.
- **Projects**: Larger projects developed to demonstrate OOP principles (e.g., Geometry & Stack Visualization App).
- **Examples**: Small code snippets and examples that illustrate key OOP concepts.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own learning. If you're a student, ensure you understand the concepts rather than copying the code directly.

Happy Learning!
